Raw material constraints, rather than profitability, are the primary limiting factor. Even if the selling price of K or M increases slightly, the optimal decision does not change. Additionally, the cost of treatment would need to rise significantly before producing K or M becomes a better alternative. This supports the accountant’s recommendation to eliminate Product K, as it is never part of the optimal solution.

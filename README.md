# TeamData
This repository contains all necessary files and scripts for the team mini projects as part of the successful completion of DS-450.

## Alternative Fueling Locations
Contains all necessary files to properly address the following project goal and scenario.

Project Goal: To create a set of dashboards to display information about alternative fuels and alternative fueling locations in the United States.

Scenario: Your team works for an environmental think tank named 21st Century Environmental Policy (21CEP).  The group works on various analysis projects across the spectrum of environmental policy including alternative fuels such as  compressed natural gas (CNG), ethanol (E85), propane/liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biodiesel (B20 and above), electric vehicle charging, hydrogen, and liquefied natural gas (LNG).  Your team has been approached by one of the policy analysts to develop a set of dashboards that provides users with a quick graphical view of alternative fuel locations (AFL) data across the United States. They want to be able to view data in a variety of ways at both the federal, regional, and state levels.

## CAPO and Time to Clinical Stability
Contains all necessary files to properly address the following project goal and scenario.

Project Goal: To generate a survival analysis curve and develop predictive models using Linear/Logistic
Regression for a real-life data set.

Scenario: You are a data analyst working for a health research company. One of the researchers in your
organization is interested in the outcomes for patients hospitalized with Community-Acquired
Pneumonia. The researcher was made aware of a multi-year retrospecive cohort study on CAP
conducted by a physician in Louisville, Kentucky who specializes in infectious diseases. Startng in 2001,
this study collected data from hospitals around the world on CAP. You have been provided with a
snapshot of the data from 2017 and asked to perform several linear/logistic analyses on the data. The
researcher is interested in building linear and/or logistic models to predict time to clinical stability (TCS).
TCS is a measure used by physicians treating CAP patients to determine when they can be discharged
and continue treatment at home.

## Chemical Manufacturing Analysis
Contains all necessary files to properly address the following project goal and scenario.

Project Goal: To analyze a chemical manufacturing process to determine the most cost-effective method
for handling liquid waste from a manufacturing process.

Scenario: Based on the information provided in the Overview, develop an approach to this problem
that will allow the company to determine how much primary product to produce, given the limitations
on the amount of raw material available. Include recommendations as to how the company should
dispose of liquid waste to satisfy the EPA. How many pounds of product K should be produced? How
many pounds of product M should be produced? How many pounds of liquid waste should be specially
treated and dumped into the Monongahela River? In your 

The analysis includes the following:
1. A cost analysis showing the profit contribution per pound for the primary product, product K,
and product M.
2. The optimal production quantities and waste disposal plan, including the project profit.
3. A discussion of the value of additional pounds of each raw material.
4. A discussion of the sensitivity analysis of the objective function coefficients.
5. Comments on the accountantâ€™s recommendation to eliminate product K as an alternative. Does
the recommendation appear reasonable? What is your reaction to the recommendation? How
would the optimal solution change if the product K were eliminated?

## Writing SQL Queries
Project Goal:  To write simple to moderately complex SQL queries to extract data from a database using both a query interface (MySQL Workbench) and a Python script.

Scenario:  You work for a small DVD rental company (mail order) [1] . The company has a database called Sakila that contains information about their films, rentals, customers, stores, etc. You have been asked to write a set of queries for the database so they can retrieve data from it.

## Building a Streamlit App
Project Goal:  To write a small web-based application with Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn and Streamlit for viewing/analyzing the Wine Quality data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)

Scenario:  You have been asked by your company to develop a proof of concept for a data set viewing application so your data analysis group can package data for end users to view.  Your supervisor suggests that you use Streamlit (https://docs.streamlit.io/) which is a library that supports developing simple web applications in Python.

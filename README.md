# TeamData
This repository contains all necessary files and scripts for the team mini projects as part of the successful completion of DS-450.

## Alternative Fueling Locations
Contains all necessary files to properly address the following project goal and scenario.
Project Goal: To create a set of dashboards to display information about alternative fuels and alternative fueling locations in the United States.
Scenario: Your team works for an environmental think tank named 21st Century Environmental Policy (21CEP).  The group works on various analysis projects across the spectrum of environmental policy including alternative fuels such as  compressed natural gas (CNG), ethanol (E85), propane/liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biodiesel (B20 and above), electric vehicle charging, hydrogen, and liquefied natural gas (LNG).  Your team has been approached by one of the policy analysts to develop a set of dashboards that provides users with a quick graphical view of alternative fuel locations (AFL) data across the United States. They want to be able to view data in a variety of ways at both the federal, regional, and state levels.

## CAPO and Time to Clinical Stability
Contains all necessary files to properly address the following project goal and scenario.
Project Goal: To generate a survival analysis curve and develop predictive models using Linear/Logistic
Regression for a real-life data set.
Scenario: You are a data analyst working for a health research company. One of the researchers in your
organization is interested in the outcomes for patients hospitalized with Community-Acquired
Pneumonia. The researcher was made aware of a multi-year retrospecive cohort study on CAP
conducted by a physician in Louisville, Kentucky who specializes in infectious diseases. Startng in 2001,
this study collected data from hospitals around the world on CAP. You have been provided with a
snapshot of the data from 2017 and asked to perform several linear/logistic analyses on the data. The
researcher is interested in building linear and/or logistic models to predict time to clinical stability (TCS).
TCS is a measure used by physicians treating CAP patients to determine when they can be discharged
and continue treatment at home.

## Chemical Manufacturing Analysis
Contains all necessary files to properly address the following project goal and scenario.
Project Goal: To analyze a chemical manufacturing process to determine the most cost-effecï¿½ve method
for handling liquid waste from a manufacturing process.
